      A single plain text only paragraph of about 200 words maximum. For
      research articles, abstracts should give a pertinent overview of the work.
      We strongly encourage authors to use the following style of structured
      abstracts, but without headings: (1) Background: place the question
      addressed in a broad context and highlight the purpose of the study; (2)
      Methods: describe briefly the main methods or treatments applied; (3)
      Results: summarize the article's main findings; (4) Conclusion: indicate
      the main conclusions or interpretations. The abstract should be an
      objective representation of the article, it must not contain results which
      are not presented and substantiated in the main text and should not
      exaggerate the main conclusions.
